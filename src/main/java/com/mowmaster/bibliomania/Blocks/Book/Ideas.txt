- Books are an item, similar to a bundle (can view contents using the tooltip)
- The selected item/block can be interacted with (can place it in world if a block, or consume it if a food item.)
- When placed on the ground, it becomes a book block
- book block can be 'opened' at which point it renders a rotating item above it to show the currently selected item,
and can be interacted with to insert/remove items
(the pages need some way to be 'flipped' that noticeable to the player) interacting with the main 'content'
is how to insert/remove items with similar controls to pedestals
- the book can be placed into a lecturn or shelf at which point itll act like a block storage container and can be hoppered/piped in and out of, the back of the shelf is the way for pipes to access the books themselves,
 the front face as well???, the other sides can be used to do automation
